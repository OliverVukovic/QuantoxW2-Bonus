                        current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
                        got every penny's worth.</p>
                    <p class="text">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
                        looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
                        amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                        found in incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                        weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                        completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as
                        a Software Engineer at VR startup."</p>

                    <p class="text">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
                        needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                        programing step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                        The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                        hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
                        next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
                        often referred to it during interviws as an example of my development
                        experience. It certanly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                        after receiving multiple offers. 100% recomended! "</p>

                        Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
                        easy.</p>
                    <p class="text">"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which i find
                        really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be

                        developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
